- 👋 Hi, I’m Martyna @martix171717

- ✨ In November 2021 I finished Kodilla Bootcamp Python Developer - a 4-month Python programming course from scratch
to the advanced level with a focus on quick use of the language in practice.

  Learned technologies and working tools:
  Python 3, Flask, Flask-WTF, WTForms, REST, Git, SQL, VisualStudio Code, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Pytest, JupyterNotebook.

- 🌱 I'm currently participating in the course: Business Analytics Nanodegree Program - Udacity Tech Scholarship 
powered by Bertelsmann, which focuses on business analysis using Excel and SQL and data visualization using Tableau.

- 💞️ I'm looking for my first commercial experience as a Junior Python Developer.
